Open your curtains. Just do it. Don't ask me why.<br/>
Please make sure you have Homebrew Launcher 1.3 on your SD card. 1.4 should work too, but 1.3 should have much better consistency. <a href="https://github.com/dimok789/homebrew_launcher/releases/tag/v1.3">You can download HBL 1.3 here</a>.<br/>
Try Exploit 2 (or the big Exploit button) first, if it doesn't work, try again, if it still doesn't work, try again, if it still doesn't work, try a different number, if it still doesn't work, try again, if it still doesn't work, clear browser save data and try again, if it still doesn't work, try again. <b><i>Just keep trying</i></b>, this has a pretty low chance of working, but it does work sometimes.<br/>
